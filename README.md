# 🏗️ Blockchain-Based Charity Donation Tracking System

This project is a decentralized charity donation platform that uses blockchain for transparency and accountability. Donations are tracked on-chain, and donors receive NFT-based donation certificates. The system is built with a React-based frontend, a Node.js backend, and Solidity smart contracts deployed using Hardhat.
